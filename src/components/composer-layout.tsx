/**
 * The frame every composer route is drawn in — and the frame its route skeleton
 * is drawn in as well.
 *
 * A skeleton that rebuilds the frame by hand drifts from it: different padding,
 * a card that bleeds to the screen edge in one and not the other, a field that
 * exists on one side only. The handoff from skeleton to form then reads as the
 * page rebuilding itself rather than finishing loading. Sharing the frame makes
 * that drift impossible, which is the whole reason this component exists.
